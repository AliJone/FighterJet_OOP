#FIGHTER JET GAME
 All aircrafts will move and animate (you need to iterate between the 3 images for every aircraft)
2. The fighter aircraft will detect the bullets and try to dodge it. If the bullet is within the dimensions of the aircraft, it will move either left or right depending on where the bullet is so that it can move in the opposite direction.
3. The bombers will just move forward
4. If the bullet hits the fighter or bomber, both will be destroyed along with the bullet
5. Fighter, Bomber, Bullet and Player will all inherit from the base Vehicle class
6. You need to implement your own doubly linked list
7. You need to have your code properly commented and follow proper coding guidelines. Refer to this link (https://rhamedy.medium.com/a-short-summary-of-java-coding-best-practices-31283d0167d3)
8. All objects that go beyond the screen or are hit by bullets should be removed from the linked list and the Player's aircraft should not go beyond the screen limits
9.Ã‚Â  You have to submit a complete UML diagram of your code both as an *.uxf and *.jpg file
10.Ã‚Â The code should work without any bugs and errors

You can use this link to understand the code for animation and collision detection:
